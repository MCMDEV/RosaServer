A linux server scripting API for [Sub Rosa](http://subrosagame.com/).

RosaServer uses [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/); this means there's no hit to performance while being able to create anything from moderation tools to complex custom games with easy-to-write version agnostic code.

# Getting Started
Comin' soon.

# Documentation
For complete reference on using the Lua API, go to the [wiki](https://github.com/RosaServer/RosaServer/wiki).

# Building
If you want to build RosaServer yourself and contribute, you can use Visual Studio and WSL, or use CMake on linux itself. You'll have to run `make` inside ./LuaJit first.
